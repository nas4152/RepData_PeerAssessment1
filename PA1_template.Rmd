## Loading and preprocessing the data

First, the dataset is unzipped if the csv file is not present.  Then the data
is stored in a variable called fitdata.  The date column is converted from a 
factor to a date class.

```{r}
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")){
        unzip("activity.zip")
}
fitdata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
fitdata$date <- as.Date(fitdata$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
sums <- summarise(group_by(fitdata, date), sum(steps))
mean(sums[ ,2], na.rm = TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
